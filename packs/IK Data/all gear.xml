						The homes in many Cygnaran coastal towns have
a tradition of keeping lines of salt in front of their doors to keep
evil spirits from entering their homes. When the minerals that
this symbolic defense originated from are properly prepared and
poured in a line upon the ground, the alchemically treated salt
forms a barrier that undead creatures and infernals cannot cross.

						<special_formatted type="formattedtext">

						A character can spend a quick action to pour
out the spirit salts. When he does so, place a wall template in
base contact with the character. Undead creatures and infernals
cannot cross that wall. The wall remains effective for d3+1
rounds and expires at the start of this character's turn on the
round determined. (The Game Master should keep the duration
a secret).
