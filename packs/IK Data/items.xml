						<description type="formattedtext">
						 A gun brace is effectively a heavy leather bandolier
for pistols. A gun brace has enough sleeves to hold three or
four pistols. Some gunfighters and pirates are even known to
wear two full braces of loaded pistols. Rather than reloading,
a character with a gun brace simply pulls another pistol each
time he wants to make an attack.
						A character wearing a gun brace can draw two pistols as a single
quick action. He can also replace his pistols without spending
a quick action.
						A cheap alternative to the gun brace favored by some pirates
is to simply tie a length of rope between two pistols and hang
them around the neck. Any character wishing to begin the
game with a rope gun brace of this kind can do so for free.

						<description type="formattedtext">
						 In addition to the specialized tools of the gunsmith's
trade, this kit includes a number of tools useful for cleaning,
disassembling, and reassembling firearms. It also includes a scale
for measuring blast powder, lead and molds for pouring shot, and
a secure area for storing completed cartridges and charges.
						A character with the Craft (gunsmithing) skill can press his own
metal cartridges at a fraction of the cost of buying ammunition
and can convert heavier cartridges to lighter cartridges with no
loss of material and lighter cartridges to heavier cartridges with
a minimal loss of material.
						A character with the required materials and either the Pistol or the
Rifle military skill can press his own metal cartridge ammunition.
A character can press up to ten rounds of ammunition in an hour.
A character who chooses to press his own ammunition rather
than purchasing ready-made ammunition can make twice as
many rounds as if he purchased them ready made. The character
must pay an additional 1 gc for metal casings unless he recycles
used brass casings and makes ammunition of that size. Thus, a
character who purchases the materials to make light ammunition
rounds at the cost of 3 gc gains enough materials to make ten
rounds instead of five at the ready-made price.

						Wrist-spring holsters are leather bracers fitted
with a spring-arm mechanism that holds a dagger or pistol in
place and can project it immediately into the wearer's hand
when triggered. This allows the wearer to draw the weapon

enables it to be easily concealed beneath a loose, billowy sleeve.

						Once unique to the workshops of the Golden
Crucible, gas masks have become a rare but not-unobtainable
piece of gear. The device is a face mask that affixes tightly
to the head with adjustable buckles and straps to create an
impermeable seal around the mouth and nose of the wearer. The
"breather" of the mask is a large oblong leather sack affixed to
the mask with a metal screw cap. Alchemically treated fibers in
the filter allow clean air in but prevent particles and alchemical
substances from permeating the filter's membranes. This allows
a man to breathe air in even the most caustic and dangerous of
environs without fear of damaging his lungs or windpipe.
						It takes a quick action to put on or take off a gas mask.
						A character wearing a gas mask gains +1 ARM against corrosion
damage and is immune to gas effects. A character wearing a
gas mask suffers -1 on sight- or hearing- based PER rolls. A gas
mask can be worn with a specially designed helmet.
						Replacement filters for a gas mask cost 5 gc each and provide
enough protection for one full hour of exposure to caustic gasses
and other undesirable particles the wearer might breathe.

dividers for measuring and spacing mountings. A mechanik
who works on steamjacks has bores, chisels, reamers, and
scrapers; injectors for priming pneumatic chambers; expanders
for piston cylinders; and a number of hammers with heads of
various shapes and sizes for shaping metal, pounding parts

						With long-perfected mundane clockwork available
to the populace, pocket watches have become relatively common
luxury items throughout the Iron Kingdoms. They are especially
fashionable among military officers and middle-class clerks,
though fine silver and gold watches are preferred among the
wealthier classes. Pocket watches are typically attached to fine
chains to keep them well secured. Most watch faces have an hour
hand only and are protected by a cover that snaps open and shut
on a tiny hinge. Minute hands are rare, since they require
more complex mechanics than hour hands. Pocket
watches run on spring technology, which employs a
coiled spring and notched wheels for the automated
hand movement. Most require winding twice a day
by means of a small key, though more advanced
watches need to be wound only once a day.

						<description type="formattedtext">
						Compressed steam is the main motivating force
of almost every technology in western Immoren. Coal-fed fires
boil water to create steam, which is fed into a pressurized vent
and funneled through a pipe into a piston chamber that uses
variable pressure to drive the piston from both sides. With
several pistons, each working in concert in larger engines,
the result is an incredibly powerful engine that can power
everything from foundry tools to locomotives.
						Portable steam engines are used to power heavy mechanik's
tools in the field and can be strapped to a man's back. Pneumatic
conduits funnel steam and compressed air to the tools, allowing
them to operate. Although the steam engines are quite heavy,
especially with a full load of coal and water, their power and
the benefits they provide to the use of powered tools often
outweigh any encumbering factors.
						Most steam tools attach to larger steam engines while in
foundry use so that refueling is less of an issue. In the field of
battle or in the dank confines of a lost ruin, the portable steam
engine is king. A portable steam engine can provide sufficient
power to a steam tool for one hour of operation at full steam
before it requires refueling. An idling engine can burn for six
hours continuously.
						Running the steam engine requires 1 gc of coal for every four
hours of continuous operation.
