						Farsight goggles are a complex piece of optical
mechanika. Originally developed for forward observers to
monitor troop movements, the high cost of the goggles has
dramatically restricted their use. Notably, they have found
a place among the agents of the Cygnaran Reconnaissance
Service who use the goggles on desperate missions when
they must navigate hostile terrain in the dead of night. The
goggles appear as a pair of heavy, three-lensed goggles with
glowing green lenses, attached to a heavy belt with a low-slung
alchemical capacitor supplying power to the device.

						While the goggles' mechanika has power,
the wearer can see in night conditions as if it were day. The

						This is a mechanikal arm that can be grafted to

						A character with a mechanikal prosthetic
arm suffers -1 to AGL and POI rolls (including attacks) when
resolving actions taken with a prosthetic arm. This penalty
extends to attacks made with two-handed weapons.

made with the arm, the damage roll is made at STR 7. When
resolving the damage of a two-handed attack, use the character's
natural STR or the arm's STR 7, whichever is higher.
						If the arm runs out of power, it becomes completely unresponsive
and cannot be used to take any action. Additionally, the
character suffers -1 DEF while is arm is not functional.

requires two hours of labor and an INT + Medicine skill roll
