						Description: This is a massive steel wrench in common use
among those who maintain and repair steamjacks in the field.
The wrench is at least three feet long and bears an impressive
weight.
						In addition to being a ubiquitous tool in the hands of skilled
field mechanik's across western Immoren, the 'jack wrench
can also be used as a melee weapon in its own right. Anyone
attacking with a 'jack wrench uses the Hand Weapon skill for
the attack. Due to the wrench's slightly clumsy weight, the
attack roll suffers a -2 penalty. When used as a weapon, the
'jack wrench has POW 3.

						<special type="string">Knockout chance on crit</special>			
						<special_formatted type="formattedtext">
						On a critical hit with a 'jack wrench, a living target hit has a
chance to be knocked out (p. 219). If the target suffers damage
from the attack, he must make a Willpower roll against a target
number equal to the attacking character's STR + 9. If the target
succeeds, he remains conscious. If he fails, he is knocked out.

in a sharp point, which curves slightly and has a counterweight
to improve ease of use. The stronger the spike, the more
effectively the tool can pierce the surface. The counterweight
is nearly always a second spike, often with a flat end for
prying. The efficient momentum of a pickaxe, combined with
the small contact area, makes it very effective for punching
through armor. Rocking an embedded spike aids in removing

						Trench swords' skull crusher hilts can be
used to make Unarmed Combat attack rolls. On a critical
hit with a skull crusher, the target is knocked down. If
a character using the skull crusher as a melee weapon
makes a knockout strike (p. 210) that damages his target,
add +2 to the target number to avoid knockout.

						A character must have at least STR 6 to use
this weapon in one hand.
						On a critical hit, a living target hit has a chance to be
knocked out (p. 219) by the attack. If the target suffers
damage from the attack, he must make a Willpower roll
against a target number equal to the attacking character's
STR + 12. If the target succeeds, he stays conscious. If he
fails, he is knocked out.
