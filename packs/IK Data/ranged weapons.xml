						This stubby tool can be the field mechanik's
best friend for securing repairs and locking armor back down
in place. It is well suited for use in combat conditions, being
light and easy to load yet durable and reliable. The rivet gun
doubles as a holdout weapon at close range. Although it doesn't
have much stopping power against heavily armored targets, in
the right hands it can prove an effective deterrent for enemy
troopers or at least buy a mechanik enough time to retreat from
making repairs.
						The gun uses rivets, each with a paper-wrapped explosive
charge in the rivet head. This mixture of blast powder is packed
the same way as a cartridge. The charge is much smaller,
designed to give just enough punch to pierce metal at extremely
close ranges. The barrel design requires placement directly on
armor plate or metal while the mechanik pulls the trigger, and
the blast charge allows the rivet to penetrate moderately thick
metal and pin it in place. The gravity-fed firing mechanism
does not jam easily, although water can creep into the rivet bin
and waterlog the rivets so they won't fire.
						The gun holds ten rivets. It takes a quick action to reload each
rivet in combat.
						As a weapon, the rivet gun is inaccurate and has an effective
range of only twenty-four feet (4?) with no extreme range. A
character making an attack with a rivet gun uses the Pistol skill
and suffers a -2 penalty on his attack roll. A character hit by a
rivet gun suffers a POW 10 damage roll.

or grip at the base for throwing, contain studs to aid in the
holding of the device, or incorporate any of a countless number

						Grenades typically have a handle locked in place by a removable
safety pin. Once the pin is pulled, the grenade is primed but
still does not explode until the handle is released, such as by
being thrown. As long as the grenade is held in the hand, the
handle remains in place. Upon the handle's release, either a
fuse ignites or a clockwork mechanism is thrown into motion,
depending on the nature of the grenade. After a few seconds
the grenade explodes.

						Once it is in hand, using a grenade requires both
a quick action and an attack. The quick action is spent pulling
the pin, and the attack is to actually throw the grenade.
						Strangle gas grenades cause no damage. The weapon's AOE is
a cloud effect, gas effect that remains in play for one round.
While in the AOE, living characters suffer -2 DEF and -2 on
attack rolls.

metal casing for each round of rune shot ammunition. Due to
the high cost of ammunition, most gun mages pour their own
rune shots (see "Craft Rune Shot," p. 160).

						Once it is in hand, using a grenade requires both
a quick action and an attack. The quick action is for pulling the
pin, and the attack is for throwing the grenade.
						Empty clockwork grenade vessels that can be armed with an
alchemist's chosen alchemical compound are available on the
open market for 5 gc, far less than
the cost of materials for an artisan
clocksmith to build the same. This
is because the militaries of the
Iron Kingdoms have developed
industrial production methods for
manufacturing grenades that have
greatly driven down their cost,
even for the unaffiliated combat
alchemist. Once an alchemist has an
empty clockwork grenade vessel, he
can carefully fill and arm it in ten
minutes without a skill roll.

is a cloud effect that remains in play for one round. An
incorporeal creature entering the AOE immediately loses
the Incorporeal ability for one round. Though alchemical
grenades filled with Ashes of Urcaen are not for sale on the
open market, they can be special ordered for 75 gc each.

						Blast arrows are made up of a heavy arrow with an alchemical warhead. The weapon
can either be primed as it is nocked, meaning it must be immediately fired, or it can
be primed while nocked with a second quick action. The blast arrow uses the bow's
RNG, has a 3? AOE, and has a -1 modifier to its attack roll. Otherwise its effect
depends on the type of grenade fired. An empty blast arrow vessel costs 10 gc.
Readily armed blast arrows can be purchased for 10 gc more than their alchemical
grenade equivalent, so a rust bomb blast arrow would cost 40 gc.

						The knockout bomb is a grenade filled
with somnolence elixir (p. 295). All characters hit by a
knockout bomb AOE must make a Willpower roll against
a target number of 16. If the character succeeds, he shakes
off the effects. If he fails, he is knocked down and falls
unconscious. The character awakens when he suffers
damage or is roused as a quick action by a character B2B
with him. The knockout bomb is a gas effect. Knockout
bombs cost 45 gc each.

						<special_formatted type="formattedtext">						
						The rust bomb is a grenade filled with both
parts of rust agent (p. 295). Its detonation mixes the parts and
unleashes a vaporized gout of fast-acting rust agent. The
rust bomb causes no damage. Steamjacks and characters
wearing metal armor hit by the AOE suffer -2 ARM for one
round unless they are immune to corrosion. Rust bombs
cost 30 gc each.
